# Beauty Products E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the **Beauty Products E-Commerce Website**! This is a front-end application designed to simulate a modern, user-friendly online store for beauty products. Users can browse, search, and explore a wide variety of beauty products, from skincare to makeup, with detailed product information and a seamless shopping experience. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the option to extend to React or Vue.js for more dynamic features), this project demonstrates how to create an intuitive, visually appealing e-commerce platform for beauty products.

## üöÄ Features

- **Product Listings**: Display detailed information about products, including product name, price, description, ratings, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Engaging, interactive features like hover effects, dynamic product listings, and a shopping cart enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- **Categories**: Products are organized into categories for easy navigation, allowing users to explore their desired beauty products by type.
- **Mock Data**: The app uses mock data or a mock API to simulate product listings, allowing for easy integration of real product data in the future.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styling for an attractive and user-friendly interface, with responsive design for all screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality such as filtering products, managing the shopping cart, and handling user interactions.
- **React/Vue.js (Optional)**: If extended, you can use these JavaScript frameworks to create reusable components, manage dynamic state, and scale the application more easily.

## üß© Key Features to Explore
